Description
--------------------------------
I use this configuration on my Arch Linux laptop.

- Added a layout I always wanted

- Keybinding changed to be vim-like. Quite good, with <Esc> remapped to <Caps_Lock> and the original <Esc> used as <Hyper>. 

- Black/orange theme with transparent terminals
